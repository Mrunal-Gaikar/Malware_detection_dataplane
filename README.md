# Detecting Malware in data plane using Machine learning

Data plane programming improves network monitoring. Here, the data plane to autonomously detects anomalies and push alerts to the controller or discard the packet.
We do conditional checks defined by the machine learning algorithm (Decision tree classifier )at the switch level.
Here,to calculate the accuracy of the implemented logic we clone the packet when a switch receives it and send it to the controller. The controller prints whether the packet is malicious or not. We then cross check it with the decision the switch had taken with respect to that packet.
On testing we got:
1. Accuracy : 88%
2. Precision : 85.8%
3. Recall : 91%
4. F1 Score : 88.3%

It consists of :

1. network.py : It defines the network topology
2. forwarding.p4 : It defines the P4 logic
3. traffic_test.py : It generates the test traffic using scapy
