# Detecting Malware in data plane using Machine learning

Data plane programming improves network monitoring. Here, the data plane to autonomously detects anomalies and push alerts to the controller or discard the packet.
We do conditional checks defined by the machine learning algorithm (Decision tree classifier )at the switch level.
